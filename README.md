# Steel Plate Fault Classification

## Overview
Steel Plate Fault Classification is a machine learning project designed to detect and classify defects in steel plates. The model leverages classification algorithms to categorize faults based on various features, helping in quality control and defect analysis in the manufacturing industry.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using multiple classification algorithms
- Performance evaluation using key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Deployment-ready model for real-world applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for Deep learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook
