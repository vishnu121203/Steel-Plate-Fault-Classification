# Steel-Plate-Fault-Classification
Steel Plate Fault Classification is an ML project that identifies defects in steel plates using classification models. Based on features like thickness, orientation, and edge defects, it predicts fault types such as scratches, cracks, or dents. Techniques like SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks enhance accuracy.
